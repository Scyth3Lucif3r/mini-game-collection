**Game Design Document (Devcon 2)**



**Concept**

The concept for our game is that two players must work with each other to fend off waves of attacking enemies for 30-60 seconds in a hectic and chaotic co-op experience.



**Setting**

The setting will most likely take place in space, with the players being space ships and the enemies being aliens.



**Game Structure**

The game would start with a simple explanation for key game mechanics and button inputs. The explanation would be on both sides of the arcade machine, enabling both players to read it easily. Then, after both players press a button to "ready up", the game begins and the players must fight enemies. Either the enemies reach the player and a game over is triggered, or the player survive 30-60 seconds and a score is displayed for each player that displays how many enemies each player defeated.



**Players**

This game is strictly 2 player co-op, it's impossible to beat with only one player.



**Actions**

Each player can move up and down on the screen and fire normal bullets that damage purple enemies and enemies of the same color. The red player has a special fireball that deals high damage with splash, meanwhile the blue player has a special freezing move, where all enemies on screen will be temporarily frozen. Both special moves have a cooldown.
