**Game Design Document (Devcon 2)**



**Concept**

The concept for our game is that two players must work with each other to fend off waves of various attacking enemies for 60 seconds.



**Setting**

The players will find themselves in the void of space, with help on the way, but not soon enough, and so the players will have to work together to survive unntil help arrives. 



**Game Structure**

The game would start with a simple explanation for key game mechanics and button inputs. The explanation would be on both sides of the arcade machine, enabling both players to read it easily. Then, after both players press a button to "ready up", the game begins and the players must fight enemies. Either the enemies reach the player and a game over is triggered, or the player survive 30-60 seconds and a score is displayed for each player that displays how many enemies each player defeated.



**Players**

This game is strictly 2 player co-op, it's impossible to beat with only one player. While most enemies can be destroyed by either player, there a some that can only be hurt by one player, indicated by their colour being similar to one of the players. 



**Actions**

Each player can move up and down on the screen and fire normal bullets that damage purple enemies and enemies of the same color. The red player has a special fireball that deals high damage with splash, meanwhile the blue player has a special freezing move, where all enemies on screen will be temporarily frozen. Both special moves have a cooldown. Each player can also jump to the other side of the screen to help eliminate their unique enemies on that side, should they show up.



**Desired Gameplay Feel**
 We wanted to make a cooperative shooter, as opposed to what we figured might be the more common pvp arcade game. We also wanted to be able to give it the classic hectic and chaotic experience of any other cooperative arcade shooter. 



 **Objective Statement**
 We wanted to make a game that would have players agressively working together to tread water in a hectic and chaotic experience where their only goal is to survive for 60 seconds.



**Design Rationale**
We were able to achieve what we set out to do in our Objective Statement through allowing for loads of enemies to show up on screen at once, forcing players to stay on their A-game to keep up, while also having to worry about hopping over to the other players side breifly if a specific players coloured enemy shows up there. We even went further to include an enemy that can't be killed by the player, but can destroy them, stunning the player for a few seconds before they respawn, costing them vital time.



**Citing Resources**
- Assistance from ChatGPT was used in our programming, since none of us are experienced enough with code to properly do everything we needed to ourselves.
- Assets and Sprites were all taken from the provided materials and assets within the repository.
